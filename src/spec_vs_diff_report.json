  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements. REQ-23 adds ICP holdings display in the sell section with clear labeling. REQ-24 implements a MAX button for the sell interface that fills the input with full ICP balance. REQ-25 implements a MAX button for the buy interface with mode-aware logic (max ICP in ICP mode, full cash in dollar mode). All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the visible code.",
