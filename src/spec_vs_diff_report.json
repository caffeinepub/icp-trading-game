  "summary": "The implementation addresses both requirements by fixing backend registration verification logic and improving frontend error handling. The backend now uses a hasUserProfile() check and getOrCreateAccount() mechanism, while the frontend's parseBackendError() distinguishes between registration, balance, and generic errors with appropriate user messaging.",

    {
      "description": "Addition of parseBackendError utility function exported from useTradingActions.ts",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest does not specify creating a separate error parsing utility or exporting it. REQ-2 only requires proper parsing of backend errors and displaying appropriate messages, but doesn't mandate this specific implementation pattern.",
