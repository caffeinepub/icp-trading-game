  "summary": "The implementation successfully replaces the candlestick chart with a line chart and integrates Kong Swap trading tools. The line chart displays simple price-time data, margin statistics overlays are preserved, and a new TradingMetrics component provides comprehensive Kong Swap data including volume, liquidity, order book, and technical indicators. All requirements appear to be implemented with synthetic fallback data when APIs are unavailable.",
