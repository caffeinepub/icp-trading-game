# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Enhance the TradingPanel with ICP holdings display and MAX buttons for both buy and sell interfaces.

**Planned changes:**
- Display the user's current ICP holdings in the sell section
- Add a MAX button to the sell interface that auto-fills the input with the user's full ICP balance
- Add a MAX button to the buy interface that auto-fills with maximum purchasable ICP (in ICP mode) or full cash balance (in dollar mode)
- Ensure MAX buttons are disabled when balances are zero or insufficient

**User-visible outcome:** Users can see their available ICP holdings when selling, and use MAX buttons to quickly fill inputs with their maximum tradeable amounts in both buy and sell modes.
