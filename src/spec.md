# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add professional technical analysis tools (RSI, MACD, moving averages, trendline drawing) to the ICP price chart and switch to accurate CoinGecko API pricing.

**Planned changes:**
- Add RSI indicator panel below the main price chart with oversold/overbought reference lines
- Add MACD indicator panel with MACD line, signal line, and histogram bars
- Add toggleable moving average overlays (20, 50, 100, 200 periods) directly on the price chart
- Add interactive trendline drawing tool allowing users to click and drag custom trendlines
- Replace current price data source with CoinGecko API for accurate real-time ICP pricing matching major exchanges

**User-visible outcome:** Users can analyze ICP price trends using professional trading indicators (RSI, MACD, moving averages) overlaid on an accurate price chart sourced from CoinGecko, and draw custom trendlines for technical analysis.
